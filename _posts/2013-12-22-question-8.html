question: What did NOT preoccupy us during this past year?
answer:
    - Rose's mom (Norlynn Egbert) continues to decline with dementia, fractured her left femur bone with a fall in June, and now lives at Wynscape Nursing Center in Wheaton.
    - We all continue to appreciate the ministries of Christ the King Church (ctk.us) - Awana Clubs, youth group, Bible studies, Hymn Sing events, Sunday School, and the weekly worship service.
    - Political campaigns and professional sporting events
    - First-grader Grace played outdoor soccer in fall with the undefeated Firecrackers team!
