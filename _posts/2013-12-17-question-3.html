question: We sold our loyal 2002 Dodge van in the summer of 2012 to buy a vehicle that could reliably transport us for years to come. What did we purchase? 
answer:
    - 2012 black Hummer
    - 1985 Dodge Dakota truck
    - 2005 gold, Buick Terraza van with 28,000 miles made available to us by some friends at church. Consequently, some other friends at church bought our Dodge van for hauling stuff and doing handy projects. It's all good.
