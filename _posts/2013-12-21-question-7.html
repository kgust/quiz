question: Which of the following quotes is NOT attributed to Grace?
answer:
    - During a van ride, our little buddy Cody was singing a "Boom Boom Pow" song. Rose said it was great "rock and roll". Not to be outdone, Grace said she knows a rock and roll song and then sang "Away in a Manger."
    - "I love SpongeBob SquarePants!"
    - One day, Grace's hair was full of static but we weren't near any water source to calm it down. So she said, "Mommy, just use the water in your mouth."
    - After buying a gallon of milk, Rose put the orange "PAID" sticker on Grace who said, "Mom, people can't be buyed." To which Rose said, "You are more valuable than all the money in the world!"
