question: What was NOT a highlight of our recent trips to North Dakota?
answer:
    - Grandma Betty and Abby made homemade oatmeal raisin cookies.
    - We went on a five-day mountain climbing excursion.
    - The girls went horseback riding on Gypsy and Stormie!
    - We went sledding around the Gustavson farmyard on a piece of plywood pulled by an ATV. It was hilarious!
